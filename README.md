# To-do-List

This is a basic website that functions as a personal to-do list. It is a personal project created with the purpose of learning full-stack technologies, including React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Google Sheets as the storage solution (I understand that Google Sheets is not a traditional database).

This To-Do List application offers several functionalities:
1. Task Management: You can store tasks to keep track of everything you need to do.
2. Status Tracking: Monitor the progress of each task by assigning one of the following statuses: Complete, In Progress, or Pending.
3. Tags/Categories: Organize your tasks by adding tags/categories to group them based on different areas or contexts.
4. Due Dates: Assign due dates to tasks to help you manage deadlines effectively.
